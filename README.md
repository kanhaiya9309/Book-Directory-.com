# Book Directory Project

This project is a Book Directory application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It serves as a comprehensive platform allowing users to manage their book collection effortlessly.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The frontend is designed with React.js to provide an intuitive and seamless user experience. Users can choose between two display formats for their books: a table view or a card view.

- **CRUD Operations:** The application supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for managing books. Users can easily add new books, edit existing ones, view detailed information by clicking the 'Info' button, and delete books as needed.

- **Interactive Feedback:** Throughout various activities, users receive real-time messages at the top of the page. Whether saving a new book, editing an entry, or deleting a book, informative messages keep users informed about the status of their actions.

- **Mongoose Database Integration:** The backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, interfaces with a MongoDB database using Mongoose. This ensures efficient storage and retrieval of book data for a seamless user experience.
